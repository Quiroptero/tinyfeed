**tinyfeed** is a CLI tool that generate a static HTML page from a collection of feeds.

It's dead simple, no database, no config file, just a CLI and some HTML 

Give it a list of RSS, Atom or JSON feeds urls and it will generate a single HTML page for it. Then you can effortlessly set it up in `crond,` `systemd` or `openrc` and voilà, you’ve got yourself a webpage that aggregates your favorite feeds.


## Feature

- RSS, Atom and JSON feeds are all supported thanks to the awesome 
[gofeed library](https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed)
- Highly customizable, especially with the ability to use external stylesheets and templates.
- Dark / Light theme based on system preference
- The generated page is lightweight and fully accessible.
- Supports a daemon mode to re-generate the output periodically.
